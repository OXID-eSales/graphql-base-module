We recommend you to create a topic branch to work on, this will come in handy when making multiple contributions or when you need to rebase you pull request onto another branch. Also we would like to encourage you to open up an issue before making your pull request.

#### What branch to send a Pull Request to?

- Backwards compatibility breaks must go to the `master` branch

If in doubt, open up an issue before writing code, so we can help you settle this and possible other questions.
